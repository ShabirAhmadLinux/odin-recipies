    <h2>Short description :</h2>
    <p>Butter Chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani, is one of the most popular and beloved dishes in Indian cuisine. Originating from Delhi, this dish features succulent pieces of chicken that are marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices, then cooked in a rich, creamy tomato-based sauce. The sauce is enriched with butter, cream, and aromatic spices such as garam masala, cumin, and fenugreek, giving it a velvety texture and a tantalizing depth of flavor. Butter Chicken is often enjoyed with naan, roti, or steamed rice, making it a comforting and indulgent meal.</p>
    <p>What sets Butter Chicken apart is its perfect balance of flavors, combining the tanginess of tomatoes, the richness of cream, and the warmth of Indian spices. The chicken is typically grilled or cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven) before being simmered in the luscious sauce, allowing it to absorb all the wonderful flavors. Whether served in a fine dining restaurant or a cozy home kitchen, Butter Chicken continues to win hearts with its irresistible taste and aromatic charm.</p>
