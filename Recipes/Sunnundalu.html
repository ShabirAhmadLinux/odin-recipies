    <h1>Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Short description :</h2>
     <p>Sunnunda is a traditional sweet from the Andhra region of India, beloved for its simple yet rich flavors. It's primarily made from urad dal (black gram) flour, which is dry-roasted to bring out a nutty aroma. This flour is then mixed with jaggery (unrefined cane sugar) or sugar, and shaped into small, round balls. A hint of ghee (clarified butter) adds a luscious, melt-in-your-mouth texture, making sunnunda a delightful treat that's both nutritious and delicious. Often, cardamom powder is added for an extra touch of warmth and fragrance.</p>
     <p>It's a treat that's not just tasty but also deeply rooted in the cultural and culinary traditions of Andhra Pradesh. Enjoying sunnunda is like taking a bite of local history and heritage! 🍬</p>
